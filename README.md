# react-apple-authentication

> ðŸš¨ Deprecated: This package's features now exist in the `expo-apple-authentication` package which tree-shakes the unused platform code for iOS and Android when it's built for web.

This library provides Apple authentication for iOS 13+. It does not yet support lower iOS versions, Android, or web.

For managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation).
